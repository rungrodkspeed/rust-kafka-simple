    A lightweight and easy-to-understand implementation of a Kafka producer and consumer built using Rust. This project demonstrates how to interact with Apache Kafka in a simple, efficient way, leveraging the performance and safety features of Rust.

## Features

- **Producer**: Send messages to Kafka topics.
- **Consumer**: Read messages from Kafka topics.
- Lightweight and minimal dependencies.
- Clean and readable Rust code for beginners and advanced developers alike.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your system.
- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) set up and running.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rungrodkspeed/rust-kafka-simple
   cd rust-kafka-simple
    ```

2. Start your Kafka server:
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

3. Run the producer:
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin producer
    ```

4. Run the consumer:
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin consumer
    ```
